Rephrase the question {{question}} completely to generate a MySQL question based on the following requirements:
- The question should be of the difficulty level {{difficulty}}
- The question should have the input testcase as: {{input_testcase}}
- The question should have the output testcase as: {{output_testcase}}

Each question will have a problem statement, input format (showing the table name, the columns, and the data type), and the output format (showing the expected output). The question should be a select query that will return the expected output.
You can change table name, column names, and data types to create a new question.
